Description: Wireless Network Interface Daemon for Low-Power Wireless SoCs
 wpantund is a user-space network interface driver/daemon
 that provides a native IPv6 network interface to a
 low-power wireless Network Co-Processor (or NCP).
 It was written and developed by Nest Labs to make supporting
 Thread connectivity on Unix-like operating systems more straightforward.
